# Train Your ML Model Summer Camp Game

Train your ML model is a summer camp game designed and programmed for the O-TE-VŘI summer camp organized by Země Nezemě in 2023.

## Game setup

The goal of each team is to create a dataset of hand-drawn images of trees and houses and train their ML model on this dataset. 

Each team has a laptop with an instance of this application running on it.

They need to run to get papers (ideally post-it notes) about 100 meters away, come back and run the opposite way also about 100 meters away where the markers are located. It is best when the light markers are placed closer, dark markers are placed middle distance, and thick black markers are placed furthest. This creates a strategy decision when creating data.

The images can be then uploaded into the application, which expands their dataset, and it gives them coins. Coins can be used in the shop to buy upgrades, both in game to improve their model, or in real life to make their drawing more efficient. 

During the game, it is good to go around the teams and give them tips about what each upgrade does, how it can be userful, and hwat are its drawbacks. 

The winner is the team with the best performing model at the end of the game.

## Installation

Step 1: Install python (and optionally create a virtual environment)

Step 2: Download this repository (either through `git clone` or as a ZIP archive and then extract it)

Step 3: Run `pip install -r requirements.in`

Step 4: If on a Mac, run the setup script using `bash ./scripts/setup.bash`. If on Windows, create the relevant folders, unzip the test_dataset, and fill in the .config file.

Step 5: Run `cd src`

Step 6: Run `python main_graphics.py`
