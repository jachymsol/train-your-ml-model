# Personal Notes

## Image processing

They can capture the image, so they can make sure that it's centered and well visible in the frame.  
Cropping is therefore not necessary.

Contrast will need a parameter to tune to recognize black from white.  
Or I could do a shade analysis automatically? 

## To get more images

Use Keras's ImageDataGenerator??
- would be an unlockable

## ToDoS

- fix bug with deleting images with the same name
- handle errors when camera breaks
- fix logging state when the program breaks
- implement better logging
- fix loading game from load state

- implement predictor on images
