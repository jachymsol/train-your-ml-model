# Personal Notes

## Image processing

They can capture the image, so they can make sure that it's centered and well visible in the frame.  
Cropping is therefore not necessary.

Contrast will need a parameter to tune to recognize black from white.  
Or I could do a shade analysis automatically? 

## To get more images

Use Keras's ImageDataGenerator??
- would be an unlockable

## ToDoS

- replace max_contrast with smart_contrast

- display model training in progress
- display active upgrades in a model

- resolve retracing warning

- logging
    - save state of app

- one-time upgrades
    - possibly server things
