# Personal Notes

## Image processing

They can capture the image, so they can make sure that it's centered and well visible in the frame.  
Cropping is therefore not necessary.

Contrast will need a parameter to tune to recognize black from white.  
Or I could do a shade analysis automatically? 

## To get more images

Use Keras's ImageDataGenerator??
- would be an unlockable

## ToDoS

- toggle Show Transformations works for saved photos display
- toggle Show Transformations works on camera display with captured photo
- toggle Show Transformations uses active upgrades
    - create state store

- improve Contrast transformation

- model evaluations
    - prototype
    - colored vs gray-scale

- server things
